<p>
    I have a BFA in Cinematography from Columbia College and recently started a Coding Bootcamp with UC Berkeley. I have an extensive background in Retail banking. In my free time I enjoy traveling to new places, playing pick up basketball with friends, & as a new husband/father I love the time I share with family.
