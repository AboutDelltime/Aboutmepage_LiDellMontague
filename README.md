 WANT to create a deployed portfolio of work samples for future employers SO THAT it can be reviewed and assessed whether im a good candidate for an open position

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work WHEN I load their portfolio THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others WHEN I click on the images of the applications THEN I am taken to that deployed application WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
